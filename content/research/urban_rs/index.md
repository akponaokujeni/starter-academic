**Background**<br />
Deriving spatial indicators pertaining to the extent, the bio-physical composition and the temporal dynamics of settlements is crucial for analyzing global urbanization patterns. Ongoing multispectral satellite missions offer unique opportunities for mapping and monitoring such urban indicators at regional to global scales. These missions are complemented by imaging spectroscopy data, which offer great possibilities for more detailed and accurate urban mapping. 


**Research**<br />
This part of my research utilizes multispectral, hyperspectral and radar data for mapping urban land cover, urban green as well as urban form and function. The dense temporal and the high spectral information contents of these data are exploited to account for challenges related to spectral similarities of urban surface types and the 3D structure of urban objects as well as to enable the analysis at different levels of thematic detail. Quantitative machine learning approaches are adopted to deal with the heterogeneous representation of the urban landscape. Investigations make use of freely available imagery and open source software such as the ðŸ‘‰[EnMAP-Box](https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and ðŸ‘‰[FORCE](https://force-eo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which potentially enables a cost-effective and regular update of urban map products.


Check out the webmap visualizations of the national-scale ðŸ‘‰[impervious and vegetation cover](https://ows.geo.hu-berlin.de/webviewer/land-cover-fractions/index.html) and ðŸ‘‰[building height](https://ows.geo.hu-berlin.de/webviewer/building-height/index.html) maps.
