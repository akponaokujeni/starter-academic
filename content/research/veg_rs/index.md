**Research**<br />

My research explores the application potential of both current and upcoming hyperspectral satellite missions for quantifying vegetation properties. Specifically, I am focusing on analyzing imaging spectroscopy data provided by the ðŸ‘‰[EnMAP mission](https://www.enmap.org/), and investigating their synergistic capabilities with multispectral time series. One key aspect of my research is to describe various vegetation cover types, such as vegetation growth forms and plant species. Additionally, I aim to assess vegetation conditions, distinguishing between green and non-photosynthetic vegetation, and retrieve vegetation parameters like biomass.
