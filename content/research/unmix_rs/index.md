**Research**<br />
My research contributes to the implementation of innovative and effective remote sensing workflows to address real-world application challenges. A specific focus is on the integration of sophisticated model training strategies and powerful machine learning methods into big data workflows. Enhancing the transferability and generalization capabilities of such workflows across space, time, and/or sensors constitutes an important step toward their operational implementation. <br />

The development of a machine learning unmixing method based on synthetic training data from spectral databases represents one of my key achievements. The approach has become a core method in several research projects and publications. The approach is implemented in the 👉[EnMAP-Box](https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and documented for 👉[E-Learning](https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usr_section/application_tutorials/urban_unmixing/tutorial.html) purposes. The functionality is also available in the python package 👉[HUB-Workflow](http://hub-workflow.readthedocs.io) and integrated into the 👉[FORCE](https://force-eo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) processing engine.
