I have several years of experience in teaching remote sensing and geoinformation science at the university and workshops. Courses include:
- Introduction into Remote Sensing
- Laboratory and field spectrometry
- Introduction into working with the EnMAP-Box
- Spectral unmixing and urban remote sensing
- Introduction to Geographic Information Systems
- Introduction into Statistics, Cartography and Geographic Information Systems
- Modeling climate and hydrological data
- Quantitative Methods in Geography


In addition, I am involved in developing educational tutorials for online learning and teaching. These developments are part of the [HYPERedu online learning platform](https://eo-college.org/now-online-hyperedu-educational-resources-on-imaging-spectroscopy/), an education initiative within the EnMAP mission.
- Regression-based unmixing of urban land cover ([Tutorial](https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usr_section/application_tutorials/urban_unmixing/tutorial.html))
- Regression-based mapping of forest aboveground biomass ([Tutorial](https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usr_section/application_tutorials/biomass_regression/tutorial.html))
