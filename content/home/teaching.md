I have several years of experience in teaching remote sensing and geoinformation science at the university and at workshops. My courses include:
- Introduction into Remote Sensing
- Laboratory and field spectrometry
- Introduction into working with the EnMAP-Box
- Spectral unmixing and urban remote sensing
- Introduction to Geographic Information Systems
- Geostatistical modeling of climate and hydrological data


I am further involved in developing educational tutorials for online learning and teaching. These developments are part of the [HYPERedu](https://eo-college.org/now-online-hyperedu-educational-resources-on-imaging-spectroscopy/) online learning platform, an education initiative within the EnMAP mission. My tutorials include:
- [Regression-based unmixing of urban land cover](https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usr_section/application_tutorials/urban_unmixing/tutorial.html)
- [Regression-based mapping of forest aboveground biomass](https://enmap-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usr_section/application_tutorials/biomass_regression/tutorial.html)
