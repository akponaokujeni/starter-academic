My research is motivated by a variety of exciting possibilities Earth observation offers to study our planetâ€™s ecosystems. I am primarily using multiple passive but also active remote sensing systems to quantify biodiversity- and climate-relevant land surface properties as well as land surface change processes. Developing and exploring innovative machine learning methods is central to my research interests. My studies extend across a wide range of application domains and contribute to the development of novel remote sensing toolkits for analyzing ecosystems under global change.
