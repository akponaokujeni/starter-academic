My research is driven by the immense potential Earth observation offers to explore and understand the ecosystems of our planet. I mainly utilize imaging spectroscopy data and multispectral time series to quantify land and vegetation cover, retrieve vegetation parameters, and monitor ecosystem change and vegetation dynamics through space and time. My studies extend across diverse terrestrial ecosystems and address environmental challenges related to global change, such as disturbance and recovery processes, or drought and wildfire impacts. Implementing innovative and effective image processing workflows for solving real-world application challenges forms the foundation of my studies.
