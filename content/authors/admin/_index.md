My scientific research focuses on bridging environmental applications and remote sensing techniques to better understand land systems under global change. To do so, I utilize high-spectral and dense-temporal satellite imagery, machine learning algorithms, and sophisticated model training strategies. My studies extend across a wide range of terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., urban areas, grasslands, shrublands, and forests) and aim at the quantification of land cover and vegetation properties (e.g., broad- to fine-scale fractional composition, phenology, and biomass) and environmental change processes (e.g., urban expansion, vegetation encroachment and ecosystem disturbances).
