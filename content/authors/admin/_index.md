My research is motivated by the variety of exciting possibilities Earth observation offers to map and monitor our planetâ€™s land surface. I am specialized in using imaging spectroscopy (hyperspectral) data, long and dense multispectral time series and machine learning techniques to quantify land cover and vegetation properties as well as land surface change processes. My studies extend across a wide range of terrestrial application domains (e.g. natural ecosystems, agricultural land, urban areas) and focus on innovative methodological developments and their user-friendly implementation as well as environmental research questions related ecosystem structure, ecosystem function and global change.
